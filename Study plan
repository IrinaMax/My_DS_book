Hi Irina, 
Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. I am looking forward to see where you progress with Dataiku. I know you have made significant progress through the academy
courses and are currently midway through your journey. However, I would like to offer you you a comprehensive 30/60/90 plan (1) to guide you in completing the remaining exercises 
and (2) to connect you to an extensive range of web-based resources. 

Given the emphasis on AI governance, this document provides a link to Key Resources, specifically the RAFT Framework for GenAI, accessible through the GenAI Bootcamp.

I anticipate that this document will be beneficial.
Best,
