Here’s a clear, practical comparison of **SPSS** vs **Dataiku** in 2025, focused on real-world data science and analysis use (especially for someone like you who already does IT consulting and might want to add data skills to your LLC services).

| Feature / Need                  | IBM SPSS (2025)                              | Dataiku (Data Science Studio – DSS) 2025     | Who wins for you? |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary strength**            | Statistics, surveys, hypothesis testing, point-and-click UI | Full end-to-end data science + MLOps platform (ingest → prep → model → deploy → monitor) | Dataiku if you want modern DS; SPSS if only stats |
| **Ease of use for non-coders**  | Extremely easy – drag-and-drop, menus, Syntax is optional | Visual “flow” builder is easy, but you’ll eventually touch Python/R/SQL | SPSS slightly easier for pure beginners |
| **Coding required?**            | Optional (you can do 95 % without code)     | Encouraged – Python, R, SQL, Scala all first-class | SPSS if you hate coding |
| **Machine Learning / AI**       | Basic ML added (random forest, neural nets) but very limited compared to open-source | Excellent – AutoML, deep learning, feature store, model registry, Git integration | Dataiku by a mile |
| **Collaboration & Governance**  | Weak – basically one user at a time          | Enterprise-grade: projects, wikis, permissions, audit logs, approvals | Dataiku |
| **Deployment of models**        | SPSS Modeler has deployment nodes, but clunky and expensive | One-click deploy to Kubernetes, APIs, batch scoring, monitoring, retraining pipelines | Dataiku |
| **Scalability**                 | Runs on your laptop or small server; struggles > few GB | Spark, Kubernetes, cloud-native – handles TB/PB scale | Dataiku |
| **Pricing 2025 (approx)**       | SPSS Statistics Base ≈ $3,300–$8,800/year per user<br>SPSS Modeler ≈ $15k+/year | Dataiku: Free edition (limited) → Enterprise starts ~$36k/year for small team, but many solo consultants get “Designer” license for $12k–18k/year or use the Free edition with restrictions | SPSS cheaper for solo stats-only; Dataiku cheaper long-term if you do real DS projects |
| **Integration with modern stack** | Weak (mostly export to CSV/CSV)            | Native connectors: Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, AWS, Azure, dbt, Git, etc. | Dataiku |
| **Typical users**               | Academics, market researchers, psychologists, healthcare statisticians | Data teams at banks, retail, tech, manufacturing; also freelance DS consultants | — |

### Recommendation for you right now (Nov 2025)

Given your situation (58, solo LLC, corp-to-corp, just getting into data offerings):

1. Start with SPSS Statistics (you can grab a 30-day full trial instantly)  
   → Perfect for quick client wins: survey analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, regression, dashboards for non-technical clients.  
   → You can deliver reports in 1–2 days and charge $2k–$5k per project without learning Python yet.

2. At the same time, spin up Dataiku Free Edition (no credit card needed)  
   → Play with AutoML, visual recipes, and real pipelines.  
   → When you land a client who wants predictive models or automation, you’ll already know the tool that scales.

3. Long-term (2026+)  
   If you start getting ML / AI requests → switch billing to Dataiku projects (clients love the governance and the pretty UI). Many freelancers charge $15k–$40k per Dataiku project because it looks “enterprise”.

Bottom line
- Need money fast + hate coding → SPSS now.  
- Want to future-proof and charge higher rates in 12–18 months → learn Dataiku (free tier is actually usable for small-medium projects).
