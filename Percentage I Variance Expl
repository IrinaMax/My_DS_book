The "percentage of variance explained" is a statistical measure that shows how much of the variation in a dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variables
in a statistical model. The formula is represented as the ratio of the Sum of Squares Explained (SSI) to the Total Sum of Squares (SST).

In different statistical analyses, this concept goes by different names: 
In regression analysis, it is known as \(R^{2}\), or the coefficient of determination.
In ANOVA, it is often called \(\eta ^{2}\) (eta-squared).
In principal component analysis (PCA), it is the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. 

The breakdown of sums of squares To understand the percentage of variance explained, you must first understand how the different "sums of squares" relate to one another: 
Total Sum of Squares (SST) This represents the total variation in the observed data for the dependent variable.
It is calculated by summing the squared differences between each observation and the overall mean of the data.
Explained Sum of Squares (SSI) Also known as the Sum of Squares due to Regression (SSR) or Sum of Squares Between (SSB), 
this value measures the variation that the model accounts for.
It is calculated by summing the squared differences between the predicted values from the model and the overall mean of the data. 
Residual Sum of Squares (SSE) Also known as the Sum of Squares of the Error (or RSS), this represents the variation in the data that the model does not explain.
It is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values from the model. 
These values have the following relationship:\(SST=SSI+SSE\)  ------  The formula and calculation 
The percentage of variance explained is calculated using the following formula:\text{% of Variance Explained} = \left(\frac{SSI}{SST}\right) \times 100
This can also be expressed as:\text{% of Variance Explained} = \left(1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}\right) \times 100

Interpretation
The resulting percentage indicates the proportion of the total variability in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables in your model. 
A value of 100% means the model perfectly explains all the variation in the dependent variable.
A value of 0% means the model explains none of the variation. The model's predictions are no better than simply using the mean of the dependent variable.
An intermediate value, such as 70%, indicates that 70% of the variance is explained by the model, while the remaining 30% is left unexplained.
